# BH FDR control-demo

This repo was created to demonstarte the BH procedure for controling the FDR.

Progrmas included:

1. BH FDR control implementation.Rmd - simple correlation test with p.ajdust function to demonstrate the procedure and contrast with other methods.

2. Simulation and metabolite network data.r - FDR power simulation and implementation on the hapo_metabolite data

3. Demo2 - Simulation to demonstrate FDR control by the BH procedure.
